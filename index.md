# GitKraken: Zero to Hero Course notes

These are the notes that I have taken whilst attending the course

We have covered a lot:

+ Introduction to version control
+ How to commit, push and pull

Later we will cover...

1. Collaborative working with GitHub
2. Questions and answers

These changes are in my repository here: ([git-lesson], https://github.com/llwiggins/git-lesson)

Thursday we will cover advanced collaborations.
